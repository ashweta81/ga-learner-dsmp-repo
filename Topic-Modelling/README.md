### Project Overview

 Topic modelling with news headlines

Problem Statement
Time to put your understanding of Topic Modelling into practice! You have a dataset of news headlines sourced from the reputable Australian news source ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corp.) over a period of 15 years. If you dig into the keywords, you will see all the important episodes shaping the last decade and how they evolved over time. Ex: financial crisis, iraq war, multiple US elections, ecological disasters, terrorism, famous people, Australian crimes etc. A much better way to comprehend these topics would be using topic modelling to find out relevant topics within a particular time frame.
The main goal of this problem is to leverage the power of techniques like LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to assign topics to unseen news headlines.
